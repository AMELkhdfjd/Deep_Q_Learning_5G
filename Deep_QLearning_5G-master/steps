You can install TensorFlow using Anaconda by following these steps:

ATTT: do the commits on directory  Deep_Q_Learning_5G not Deep_QLearning_5G-master
ATTT: do the upgrade before installing on the vm, with sudo apt update, sudo apt upgrade
install tensorflow from the website not here
this command will fix the issue with the new vm : pip install --upgrade charset_normalizer




1. Create a new conda environment. Open Anaconda Prompt or Terminal and run the following command:

   ```
   conda create --name myenv
   ```

   Replace `myenv` with the name you want to give your environment.

2. Activate the new environment by running:

   ```
   conda activate myenv
   ```

   Replace `myenv` with the name of your environment.

3. Install TensorFlow using conda by running:

   ```
   conda install tensorflow
   ```

   This will install the latest stable version of TensorFlow along with its dependencies.

4. Verify the installation by running a simple TensorFlow program:

   ```
   python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.reduce_sum(tf.random.normal([1000, 1000])))"
   ```

   If TensorFlow is installed correctly, you should see a random number printed to the console.

That's it! You now have TensorFlow installed in your Anaconda environment. You can use this environment to develop and run TensorFlow applications without worrying about conflicting dependencies with other projects on your system.





5. in order to run the main_deepsara, cd to the directory deep then activate myenv by running: conda activate myenv
then execute the file with python3 not python, att we've reinstalled all the AI libraries with python3 

ATTTT:  you sould be on the myenv in order to work, if not you need to reinstall the libraries for the base env like networkx

6. install torch for the GCN modules, using:   conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio cudatoolkit=10.2 -c pytorch

7.  pip3 install tqdm
    pip3 install torch_geometric
    pip3 install texttable



############### GIT problem of Commit ################
rm -rf .git

git init

git remote add origin ssh://git@github.com/YourUsername/repoName.git

git fetch origin master

git checkout master


ATT, whatever do the git operations on the deep folder not the parent



############ alternative of the commit problem ################
create a new folder and clone the git repo and then cd to the directory and update the files regenerate other ones and commit the changes 



###### Steps to prepare the evnrirenemnt on the vm

1. install the tensorflow with conda using this link:

https://www.tensorflow.org/install/pip   (install conda & tensorflow) start a new terminal to make conda work

2. install networkx, numpy, matplotlib using : sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3-dev python3-pip
pip3 install networkx
pip3 install numpy
pip3 install matplotlib




Notes:

on the vm, all the env is installed, u can delete the directory and clone again with no issue


gcloud compute ssh --zone "europe-west2-c" "pfe" --project "atlantean-glyph-387919"


to clone a repo to my vm: git clone https://AMELkhdfjd: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@github.com/AMELkhdfjd/Deep_Q_Learning_5G.git  --branch=main PFE


run in detached mode: nohup python3 /path/to/main.py > output.log 2>&1 &
