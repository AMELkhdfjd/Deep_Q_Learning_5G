You can install TensorFlow using Anaconda by following these steps:

1. Create a new conda environment. Open Anaconda Prompt or Terminal and run the following command:

   ```
   conda create --name myenv
   ```

   Replace `myenv` with the name you want to give your environment.

2. Activate the new environment by running:

   ```
   conda activate myenv
   ```

   Replace `myenv` with the name of your environment.

3. Install TensorFlow using conda by running:

   ```
   conda install tensorflow
   ```

   This will install the latest stable version of TensorFlow along with its dependencies.

4. Verify the installation by running a simple TensorFlow program:

   ```
   python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.reduce_sum(tf.random.normal([1000, 1000])))"
   ```

   If TensorFlow is installed correctly, you should see a random number printed to the console.

That's it! You now have TensorFlow installed in your Anaconda environment. You can use this environment to develop and run TensorFlow applications without worrying about conflicting dependencies with other projects on your system.





5. in order to run the main_deepsara, cd to the directory deep then activate myenv by running: conda activate myenv
then execute the file with python3 not python, att we've reinstalled all the AI libraries with python3 

ATTTT:  you sould be on the myenv in order to work, if not you need to reinstall the libraries for the base env like networkx
